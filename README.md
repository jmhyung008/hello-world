# hello-world
new and creating my repository

I'm a student from the Philippines and I want to learn coding as fast as I can. I want to understand the world of programming. I want to be known also as one of the great programmer of all time. Thanks for reading this. :-)
I want to change my study habit also from being lazy to a geek programmer.
